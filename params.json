Xcode 4.4+ is required.\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\n### Using Storyboard (Interface Builder)\r\n\r\n![Storyboard](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/kiding/DSFlipView/storyboard.png)\r\n\r\nYou can use DSFlipView with Storyboard. \r\n\r\n1. Link `QuartzCore.framework` at the project summary.\r\n2. Add `DSFlipView.h` `DSFlipView.m` to your project.\r\n3. At storyboard, attach an empty view and change its class to `DSFlipView`.\r\n4. Move the views you want to display inside the flip view in order to make them subviews of it.\r\n5. Connect the outlets. `backView` is to the background (usually its super) view, `smallView` is to the view to be displayed first(\"closed\"), and  `bigView` is to the view next(\"opened\").\r\n\r\nSome properties would be adjustable with code; check out below.\r\n\r\n### Code Implmentation\r\n\r\n```\r\nUIView *smallView = …;\r\nUIView *bigView = …;\r\nDSFlipView *flip = [[DSFlipView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 20, 80, 80)];\r\nflip.backView = self.view;\r\nflip.smallView = smallView;\r\nflip.bigView = bigView;\r\nflip.duration = 1.0f;\r\nflip.bigSize = (CGSize){200,250};\r\n[self.view addSubview:flip];\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cloud.github.com/downloads/kiding/DSFlipView/structure.png\" alt=\"View Structure of Example\">\r\n\r\n\r\n| Properties | (Required)\t\t\t\t\t\t                                        |\r\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| backView   | Background view, usually the superview.                                  |\r\n| smallView  | Initially displayed view.                                                |\r\n| bigView    | View to be displayed after. The position will be the center of backView. |\r\n\r\n| Properties | (Optional)                                                                                           |\r\n| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| duration   | Duration of the flip animation.                                                                      |\r\n| bigSize    | Size of bigView. Even if bigView is made with certain frame, it will be shrunken down/up to bigSize. |\r\n| isOpened   | Indicates the view is \"opened\", bigView is visible and smallView is not.                             |\r\n| dummyView  | View to be returned to the original point when the view is \"opened\".                                 |\r\n| blackView  | View to accept user's gesture to \"close\" the view.                                                   |\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis project is under MIT License.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Dongsung \"Don\" Kim kiding@me.com\r\n \r\n Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n \r\n The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n \r\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
